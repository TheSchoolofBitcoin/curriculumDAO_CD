# The School Of Bitcoin Open Curriculum
The School of Bitcoin Open Curriculum is based on the open source content framework developed by hu3agency. By completing the steps below, students will create a nine section learning strategy set to a playlist of nine of their favorite songs. Each section takes in inputs from the curriculum creator to generate a hash value.

## b0mission
With b0mission, you use music and book quotes to define the foundation of the language & mission for your open source curriculum. The b0mission hash function takes four variables: `gr0v0song`, `gr0v1ego`, `gr0v2biomimicry`, and `gr0v3willpower`.
```
let b0mission = SHA256(gr0ourSource);

let gr0ourSource = {
  longPlay:        "LP_NAME",
  epicPlaylist:    "EP_Name",
  gr0v0song:       "SONG_NAME by ARTIST",
